We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose potential vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps to report any issues:

1. **Contact**: Send an email to [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com) with the subject line "Security Issue: [Brief Description]".
2. **Description**: Include as much information as possible about the issue, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact on the project
   - Any relevant code snippets or screenshots
3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and aim to provide a more detailed response within 7 business days, including a plan for addressing the issue if it is confirmed.

We request that you **do not publicly disclose** any vulnerabilities until we have resolved them.

## Security Best Practices

While **My Kitenge Wardrobe** does not directly handle sensitive data, adhering to the following practices will ensure greater security for all contributors and users:

### 1. Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Information
- Avoid including any sensitive keys, tokens, or credentials directly in the codebase. Use environment variables or secure storage for this purpose.

### 2. Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies by running:
  ```bash
  flutter pub upgrade
  ```
- Ensure all dependencies are from trusted sources and actively maintained.

### 3. Secure Image Storage
- Images uploaded by users are stored locally and do not connect to external servers. Make sure to apply file permissions as necessary if you expand to online storage in the future.

### 4. Input Validation
- Although this app currently has limited inputs, any user input should be validated and sanitized, especially if additional features (e.g., user-generated content, API integration) are added in the future.

## Handling Security Issues

If a security vulnerability is confirmed, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Issue Mitigation**: The vulnerability will be addressed in a private branch until a solution is verified.
2. **Patch Release**: A patched release will be created and deployed with an announcement in the release notes.
3. **Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability details and remediation steps after the patch has been applied to ensure users can update their installations.
